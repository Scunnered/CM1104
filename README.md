# CM1104 Object Oriented Programming

On completion of this module, students are expected to be able to:


Identify the main elements of an object oriented language and describe the software development problems that these features are meant to overcome.
Use an API to design, implement and test solutions to software development problems using interacting objects.
Use an API to design, implement and test solutions to software development problems using interacting objects.
Use an appropriate modelling language to develop diagrammatic representations of problems in order to illustrate relations and interactions between software objects.
Identify and assess security concerns and mitigate elements of risk in the software development process.
Indicative Content

Software Basics: Variable, data types, declarations and expressions, iterative and conditional programming constructs, methods, recursion. 
OO Concepts: Encapsulation, abstraction, data hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, code reuse. Security aspects of object oriented software development. 
OO Programming: Classes and objects, arrays, exception handling, defensive programming, simple data structures, Application Programming Interfaces. 
Modelling and Design: UML class diagrams, interaction diagrams.
Standards and Best Practice Guides: ISO 27001, ISO 27014.

Assessment will be via lab tests.  
These will be timed exercises in Java which will be graded. 
Usually this will include some aspect of design as well as some code.

There are expected to be 2 assessments and the grades of these will be aggregated to produce an overall grade for the module.
