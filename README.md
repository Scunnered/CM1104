I created a repository for various coding tasks that I performed as part of my study in object-oriented programming. The primary objective of my study was to outline an object-oriented language's fundamental properties and describe the software development challenges these features are designed to address. I was taught how to design, implement, and test solutions to software development challenges involving interacting objects using an application programming interface (API). Additionally, I learned how to utilise a modelling language to create diagrammatic representations of issues that depict the links and interactions between software elements. This issue focused on identifying and evaluating security issues that occur throughout the software development process and mitigating fundamental risks.

The principles of software creation are introduced, including variables and data types, defining and evaluating expressions, iterative and conditional programming approaches, procedures, and recursion. Object-oriented ideas include encapsulation, abstraction, data hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, and code reuseâ€”considerations for security in object-oriented software development. Object-oriented programming is exemplified by classes and objects, arrays, exception handling, defensive programming, fundamental data structures, and application programming interfaces.
